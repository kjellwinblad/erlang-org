<p>This EEP extends the <code>begin ... end</code> expression to make it a construct
usable for control flow and value-based error handling based on pattern
matching.</p>

<p>This introduces <code>begin ... else ... end</code> along with a new contextual use
of the <code>&lt;-</code> operator to replace or simplify deeply-nested <code>case ... end</code>
expressions, and prevent using exceptions for control flow.</p>

      </h1>
    

<p>The current syntax for a <code>begin ... end</code> expression is:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">begin
    Exprs
end
</code></pre>

<p>The expression does not have a restricted scope, and is mostly used to
group multiple distinct expressions as a single block. We propose a new
type of expressions (denoted <code>MatchOrReturnExprs</code>), only valid within a
<code>begin ... end</code> expression:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">begin
    Exprs | MatchOrReturnExprs
end
</code></pre>

<p><code>MatchOrReturnExprs</code> are defined as having the following form:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">Pattern &lt;- Expr
</code></pre>

<p>This definition means that <code>MatchOrReturnExprs</code> are only allowed at the
top-level of <code>begin ... end</code> expressions.</p>

<p>The <code>&lt;-</code> operator takes the value return by <code>Expr</code> and pattern matches on
it against <code>Pattern</code>.</p>

<p>If the pattern matches, all variables from <code>Pattern</code> are bound in the local
environment, and the expression is equivalent to a successful <code>Pattern = Expr</code>
call. If the value does not match, the <code>begin ... end</code> expression returns the
failed expression directly.</p>

<p>A special case exists in which we extend <code>begin ... end</code> into the following form:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">begin
    Exprs | MatchOrReturnExprs
else
    Pattern -&gt; Exprs;
    ...
    Pattern -&gt; Exprs
end
</code></pre>

<p>This form exists to capture non-matching expressions in a <code>MatchOrReturnExprs</code>
to handle failed matches rather than returning their value. In such a case, an
unhandled failed match will raise an <code>else_clause</code> error, otherwise identical to
a <code>case_clause</code> error.</p>

<p>This extended form is useful to properly identify and handle successful and
unsuccessful matches within the same construct without risking to confuse
happy and unhappy paths.</p>

<p>Given the structure described here, the final expression may look like:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">begin
    Foo = bar(),            % normal exprs still allowed
    {ok, X} &lt;- f(Foo),
    [H|T] &lt;- g([1,2,3]),
    ...
else
    {error, Y} -&gt;
        {ok, "default"};
    {ok, _Term} -&gt;
        {error, "unexpected wrapper"}
end
</code></pre>

<p>Do note that to allow easier pattern matching and more intuitive usage,
the <code>&lt;-</code> operator should have associativity rules lower than <code>=</code>, such that:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">begin
    X = [H|T] &lt;- exp()
end
</code></pre>

<p>is a valid <code>MatchOrReturnExprs</code> equivalent to the non-infix form <code>'&lt;-'('='(X,
[H|T]), exp())</code>, since reversing the priorities would give <code>'='('&lt;-'(X, [H|T]),
exp())</code>, which would create a <code>MatchOrReturnExp</code> out of context and be invalid.
In a nutshell, the matching rules for the <code>&lt;-</code> operator should align closely
with the usage known in list comprehensions.</p>

<p>Erlang has some of the most flexible error handling available across a
large number of programming languages. The language supports:</p>

<ol>
  <li>three types of exceptions (<code>throw</code>, <code>error</code>, <code>exit</code>)
    <ul>
      <li>handled by <code>catch Exp</code></li>
      <li>handled by <code>try ... [of ...] catch ... [after ...] end</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>links, <code>exit/2</code>, and <code>trap_exit</code></li>
  <li>monitors</li>
  <li>return values such as <code>{ok, Val} | {error, Term}</code>, <code>{ok, Val} |
false</code>, or <code>ok | {error, Val}</code></li>
  <li>A combination of one or more of the above</li>
</ol>

<p>So why should we look to add more? There are various reasons for this,
including trying to reduce deeply nested conditional expressions,
cleaning up some messy patterns found in the wild, and providing a better
separation of concerns when implementing functions.</p>
      <h2 id="reducing-nesting">
        
        
          Reducing Nesting <a href="#reducing-nesting">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>One common pattern that can be seen in Erlang is deep nesting of <code>case
... end</code> expressions, to check complex conditionals.</p>

<p>Take the following code taken from
<a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/a0ae44f324576104760a63fe6cf63e0ca31756fc/lib/mnesia/src/mnesia_backup.erl#L106-L126">Mnesia</a>,
for example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">commit_write(OpaqueData) -&gt;
    B = OpaqueData,
    case disk_log:sync(B#backup.file_desc) of
        ok -&gt;
            case disk_log:close(B#backup.file_desc) of
                ok -&gt;
                    case file:rename(B#backup.tmp_file, B#backup.file) of
                       ok -&gt;
                            {ok, B#backup.file};
                       {error, Reason} -&gt;
                            {error, Reason}
                    end;
                {error, Reason} -&gt;
                    {error, Reason}
            end;
        {error, Reason} -&gt;
            {error, Reason}
    end.
</code></pre>

<p>The code is nested to the extent that shorter aliases must be introduced
for variables (<code>OpaqueData</code> renamed to <code>B</code>), and half of the code just
transparently returns the exact values each function was given.</p>

<p>By comparison, the same code could be written as follows with the new
construct:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">commit_write(OpaqueData) -&gt;
    begin
        ok &lt;- disk_log:sync(OpaqueData#backup.file_desc),
        ok &lt;- disk_log:close(OpaqueData#backup.file_desc),
        ok &lt;- file:rename(OpaqueData#backup.tmp_file, OpaqueData#backup.file),
        {ok, OpaqueData#backup.file}
    end.
</code></pre>

<p>Or, to protect against <code>disk_log</code> calls returning something else than <code>ok |
{error, Reason}</code>, the following form could be used:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">commit_write(OpaqueData) -&gt;
    begin
        ok &lt;- disk_log:sync(OpaqueData#backup.file_desc),
        ok &lt;- disk_log:close(OpaqueData#backup.file_desc),
        ok &lt;- file:rename(OpaqueData#backup.tmp_file, OpaqueData#backup.file),
        {ok, OpaqueData#backup.file}
    else
        {error, Reason} -&gt; {error, Reason}
    end.
</code></pre>

<p>The semantics of these calls are identical, except that it is now
much easier to focus on the flow of individual operations and either
success or error paths.</p>
      <h2 id="obsoleting-messy-patterns">
        
        
          Obsoleting Messy Patterns <a href="#obsoleting-messy-patterns">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>Frequent ways in which people work with sequences of failable operations
include folds over lists of functions, and abusing list comprehensions.
Both patterns have heavy weaknesses that makes them less than ideal.</p>

<p>Folds over list of functions use patterns such as those defined in
<a href="http://erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2017-September/093575.html">posts from the
mailing</a>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">pre_check(Action, User, Context, ExternalThingy) -&gt;
    Checks =
        [fun check_request/1,
         fun check_permission/1,
         fun check_dispatch_target/1,
         fun check_condition/1],
    Args = {Action, User, Context, ExternalThingy},
    Harness =
        fun
            (Check, ok)    -&gt; Check(Args);
            (_,     Error) -&gt; Error
        end,
    case lists:foldl(Harness, ok, Checks) of
        ok    -&gt; dispatch(Action, User, Context);
        Error -&gt; Error
    end.
</code></pre>

<p>This code requires declaring the functions one by one, ensuring the
entire context is carried from function to function. Since there is no
shared scope between functions, all functions must operate on all
arguments.</p>

<p>By comparison, the same code could be implemented with the new construct
as:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">pre_check(Action, User, Context, ExternalThingy) -&gt;
    begin
        ok &lt;- check_request(Context, User),
        ok &lt;- check_permissions(Action, User),
        ok &lt;- check_dispatch_target(ExternalThingy),
        ok &lt;- check_condition(Action, Context),
        dispatch(Action, User, Context)
    end.
</code></pre>

<p>And if there was a need for derived state between any two steps, it
would be easy to weave it in:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">pre_check(Action, User, Context, ExternalThingy) -&gt;
    begin
        ok &lt;- check_request(Context, User),
        ok &lt;- check_permissions(Action, User),
        ok &lt;- check_dispatch_target(ExternalThingy),
        DispatchData &lt;- dispatch_target(ExternalThingy),
        ok &lt;- check_condition(Action, Context),
        dispatch(Action, User, Context)
    end.
</code></pre>

<p>The list comprehension <em>hack</em>, by comparison, is a bit more rare. In
fact, it is mostly theoretical. Some things that hint at how it could
work can be found in <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/869537a9bf799c8d12fc46c2b413e532d6e3b10c/lib/diameter/test/diameter_examples_SUITE.erl#L254-L266">Diameter test
cases</a>
or the <a href="https://github.com/ferd/rebar3_proper/blob/e7eb96498a9d31f41c919474ec6800df62e237e1/src/rebar3_proper_prv.erl#L298-L308">PropEr plugin for
Rebar3</a>.</p>

<p>Its overal form uses generators in list comprehensions to tunnel a happy
path:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">[Res] =
    [f(Z) || {ok, W} &lt;- [b()],
             {ok, X} &lt;- [c(W)],
             {ok, Y} &lt;- [d(X)],
             Z &lt;- [e(Y)]],
Res.
</code></pre>

<p>This form doesn’t see too much usage since it is fairly obtuse and I
suspect most people have either been reasonable enough not to use it, or
did not think about it. Obviously the new form would be cleaner:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">begin
    {ok, W} &lt;- b(),
    {ok, X} &lt;- c(W),
    {ok, Y} &lt;- d(X),
    Z = e(Y),
    f(Z)
end
</code></pre>

<p>which on top of it, has the benefit of returning an error value if one
is found.</p>

<p>This form is not necessarily obvious at a first glance. To better
expose it, let’s take a look at some functions defined in the
<a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/869537a9bf799c8d12fc46c2b413e532d6e3b10c/lib/sasl/src/release_handler.erl#L1894-L1923"><code>release_handler</code> module in

<p>At a glance, it is very difficult to clean up this code: there are 3
multi-node operations (backing up, updating, and moving release data),
each of which relies on the previous one to succeed.</p>

<p>You’ll also notice that each error requires special handling, reverting
or removing specific operations on success or on failure. This is not a
simple question of tunnelling values in and out of a narrow scope.</p>

<p>Another thing to note is that this module, as a whole (and not just the
snippet presented here) uses <code>throw</code> expressions to operate non-local
return. The actual point of return handling these is spread through
various locations in the file:
<a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/869537a9bf799c8d12fc46c2b413e532d6e3b10c/lib/sasl/src/release_handler.erl#L381-L388"><code>create_RELEASES/4</code></a>,
and
<a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/869537a9bf799c8d12fc46c2b413e532d6e3b10c/lib/sasl/src/release_handler.erl#L1864-L1881"><code>write_releases_1/3</code></a>
for example.</p>

<p>The <code>case catch Exp of</code> form is used throughout the file because
value-based error flow is painful in nested structures.</p>

<p>So let’s take a look at how we could refactor this with the new
construct:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">write_releases_m(Dir, NewReleases, Masters) -&gt;
    RelFile = filename:join(Dir, "RELEASES"),
    Backup = filename:join(Dir, "RELEASES.backup"),
    Change = filename:join(Dir, "RELEASES.change"),
    begin
        ok &lt;- backup_releases(Dir, NewReleases, Masters, Backup, Change,
                              RelFile),
        ok &lt;- update_releases(Dir, NewReleases, Masters, Backup, Change),
        ok &lt;- move_releases(Dir, NewReleases, Masters, Backup, Change, RelFile)
    end.

backup_releases(Dir, NewReleases, Masters, Backup, Change, RelFile) -&gt;
    case at_all_masters(Masters, ?MODULE, do_copy_files,
                        [RelFile, [Backup, Change]]) of
        ok -&gt;
            ok;
        {error, {Master, R}} -&gt;
            remove_files(Master, [Backup, Change], Masters)
            {error, {Master, R, backup_releases}}
    end.

update_releases(Dir, NewReleases, Masters, Backup, Change) -&gt;
    case at_all_masters(Masters, ?MODULE, do_write_release,
                        [Dir, "RELEASES.change", NewReleases]) of
        ok -&gt;
            ok;
        {error, {Master, R}} -&gt;
            remove_files(all, [Backup, Change], Masters),
            {error, {Master, R, update_releases}}
    end.

move_releases(Dir, NewReleases, Masters, Backup, Change, RelFile) -&gt;
    case at_all_masters(Masters, file, rename, [Change, RelFile]) of
        ok -&gt;
            remove_files(all, [Backup, Change], Masters),
            ok;
        {error, {Master, R}} -&gt;
            takewhile(Master, Masters, file, rename, [Backup, RelFile]),
            remove_files(all, [Backup, Change], Masters),
            {error, {Master, R, move_releases}}
    end.
</code></pre>

<p>The only reasonable way to rewrite the code was to extract all three
major multi-node operations into distinct functions.</p>

<p>The improvements are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The consequence of failing an operation is located near where the
operation takes place</li>
  <li>The functions have return values that Dialyzer can more easily
typecheck</li>
  <li>The functions are inherently more testable independently</li>
  <li>Context can still be added and carried on the generalized workflow at
the parent level</li>
  <li>The chain of successful operations is very obvious and readable</li>
  <li>Exceptions are no longer required to make the code work, but if we
needed it, only one <code>throw()</code> would be needed in <code>write_release_m</code>,
therefore separating the flow control details from specific function
implementations.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a control experiment, let’s try reusing our shorter functions with
the previous flow:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">%% Here is the same done through exceptions:
write_releases_m(Dir, NewReleases, Masters) -&gt;
    RelFile = filename:join(Dir, "RELEASES"),
    Backup = filename:join(Dir, "RELEASES.backup"),
    Change = filename:join(Dir, "RELEASES.change"),
    try
        ok = backup_releases(Dir, NewReleases, Masters, Backup, Change,
                             RelFile),
        ok = update_releases(Dir, NewReleases, Masters, Backup, Change),
        ok = move_releases(Dir, NewReleases, Masters, Backup, Change, RelFile)
    catch
        {error, Reason} -&gt; {error, Reason}
    end.

backup_releases(Dir, NewReleases, Masters, Backup, Change, RelFile) -&gt;
    case at_all_masters(Masters, ?MODULE, do_copy_files,
                        [RelFile, [Backup, Change]]) of
        ok -&gt;
            ok;
        {error, {Master, R}} -&gt;
            remove_files(Master, [Backup, Change], Masters)
            throw({error, {Master, R, backup_releases}})
    end.

update_releases(Dir, NewReleases, Masters, Backup, Change) -&gt;
    case at_all_masters(Masters, ?MODULE, do_write_release,
                        [Dir, "RELEASES.change", NewReleases]) of
        ok -&gt;
            ok;
        {error, {Master, R}} -&gt;
            remove_files(all, [Backup, Change], Masters),
            throw({error, {Master, R, update_releases}})
    end.

move_releases(Dir, NewReleases, Masters, Backup, Change, RelFile) -&gt;
    case at_all_masters(Masters, file, rename, [Change, RelFile]) of
        ok -&gt;
            remove_files(all, [Backup, Change], Masters),
            ok;
        {error, {Master, R}} -&gt;
            takewhile(Master, Masters, file, rename, [Backup, RelFile]),
            remove_files(all, [Backup, Change], Masters),
            throw({error, {Master, R, move_releases}})
    end.
</code></pre>

<p>Very little changes in the three distributed functions. However, the weakness
of this approach is that we have intimately tied implementation details of the
small functions to their parent’s context.  This makes it hard to reason about
these functions in isolation or to reuse them in a different context.
Furthermore, the parent function may capture <code>throws</code> not intended for it.</p>

<p>It is my opinion that using value-based flow control, through similar
refactorings, yields safer and cleaner code, which also happens to have
far more reduced levels of nesting. It should therefore be possible to
express more complex sequences of operations without making them any
harder to read, nor reason about in isolation.</p>

<p>That is in part due to the nesting, but also because we take a more
compositional approach, where there is no need to tie local functions’
implementation details to the complexity of their overall pipeline and
execution context.</p>

<p>It is also the best way to structure code in order to handle all
exceptions and to provide the context they need as close as possible to
their source, and as far as possible from the integrated flow.</p>

      </h2>
    

<p>Multiple languages have value-based exception handling, many of which
have a strong functional slant.</p>
      <h3 id="haskell">
        
        
          Haskell <a href="#haskell">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>The most famous case is possibly Haskell with the <code>Maybe</code> monad, which
uses either <code>Nothing</code> (meaning the computation returned nothing) or
<code>Just x</code> (their type-based equivalent of <code>{ok, X}</code>). The union of both
types is denoted <code>Maybe x</code>. The following examples are taken from
<a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Understanding_monads/Maybe">Haskell/Understanding
monads/Maybe</a>.</p>

<p>Values for such errors are tagged in functions as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">safeLog :: (Floating a, Ord a) =&gt; a -&gt; Maybe a
safeLog x
    | x &gt; 0     = Just (log x)
    | otherwise = Nothing
</code></pre>

<p>Using the type annotations directly, it is possible to extract values
(if any) through pattern matching:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">zeroAsDefault :: Maybe Int -&gt; Int
zeroAsDefault mx = case mx of
    Nothing -&gt; 0
    Just x -&gt; x
</code></pre>

<p>One thing to note here is that as long as you are not able to find a
value to substitute for <code>Nothing</code> or that you cannot take a different
branch, you are forced to carry that uncertainty with you through all
the types in the system.</p>

<p>This is usually where Erlang stops. You have the same possibilities
(albeit dynamically checked), along with the possibility of transforming
invalid values into exceptions.</p>

<p>Haskell, by comparison, offers monadic operations and its <em>do notation</em>
to abstract over things:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">getTaxOwed name = do
  number       &lt;- lookup name phonebook
  registration &lt;- lookup number governmentDatabase
  lookup registration taxDatabase
</code></pre>

<p>In this snippet, even though the <code>lookup</code> function returns a <code>Maybe x</code>
type, the do notation abstracts away the <code>Nothing</code> values, letting the
programmer focus on the <code>x</code> part of <code>Just x</code>. Even though the code is
written as if we can operate on discrete value, the function
automatically re-wraps its result into <code>Just x</code> and any <code>Nothing</code> value
just bypasses operations.</p>

<p>As such, the developer is forced to acknowledge that the whole
function’s flow is conditional to values being in place, but they can
nevertheless write it mostly as if everything were discrete.</p>
      <h3 id="ocaml">
        
        
          OCaml <a href="#ocaml">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>OCaml supports exceptions, with constructs such as <code>raise (Type
"value")</code> to raise an exception, and <code>try ... with ...</code> to handle them.
However, since exceptions wouldn’t be tracked by the type system,
maintainers introduced a <code>Result</code> type.</p>

<p>The type is defined as</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">type ('a, 'b) result =
  | Ok of 'a
  | Error of 'b
</code></pre>

<p>which is reminiscent of Erlang’s <code>{ok, A}</code> and <code>{error, B}</code>. OCaml users
appear to mostly use pattern matching, combinator libraries, and monadic
binding to deal with value-based error handling, something similar to
Haskell’s usage.</p>
      <h3 id="rust">
        
        
          Rust <a href="#rust">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>Rust defines two types of errors: unrecoverable ones (using <code>panic!</code>)
and recoverable ones, using the <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> values. The latter is of
interest to us, and defined as:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">enum Result&lt;T, E&gt; {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which would intuitively translate to Erlang terms <code>{ok, T}</code> and <code>{error,
E}</code>. The simple way to handle these in Rust is through pattern matching:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">let f = File::open("eep.txt");
match f {
    Ok(file) =&gt; do_something(file),
    Err(error) =&gt; {
        panic!("Error in file: {:?}", error)
    },
};
</code></pre>

<p>Specific error values have to be well-typed, and it seems that the Rust
community is still debating implementation details about how to best get
composability and annotations within a generic type.</p>

<p>However, their workflow for handling these is well-defined already. This
pattern matching form has been judged too cumbersome. To automatically
panic on error values, the <code>.unwrap()</code> method is added:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">let f = File::open("eep.txt").unwrap();
</code></pre>

<p>In Erlang, we could approximate this with:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">unwrap({ok, X}) -&gt; X;
unwrap({error, T}) -&gt; exit(T).

F = unwrap(file:open("eep.txt", Opts)).
</code></pre>

<p>Another construct exists to return errors to caller code more directly,
without panics, with the <code>?</code> operator:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">fn read_eep() -&gt; Result&lt;String, io::Error&gt; {
    let mut h = File::open("eep.txt")?;
    let mut s = String::new();
    h.read_to_string(&amp;mut s)?;
    Ok(s)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Any value <code>Ok(T)</code> encountering <code>?</code> is unwrapped. Any value <code>Err(E)</code>
encountering <code>?</code> is returned to the caller as-is, as if a <code>match</code> with
<code>return</code> had been used. This operator however requires that the
function’s type signature use the <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> type as a return value.</p>

<p>Prior to version 1.13, Rust used the <code>try!(Exp)</code> macro to the same
effect, but found it too cumbersome. Compare:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">try!(try!(try!(foo()).bar()).baz())
foo()?.bar()?.baz()?
</code></pre>
      <h3 id="swift">
        
        
          Swift <a href="#swift">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>Swift supports exceptions, along with type annotations declaring that a
function may raise exceptions, and <code>do ... catch</code> blocks.</p>

<p>There is a special operator <code>try?</code> which catches any thrown exception
and turns it into <code>nil</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">func someThrowingFunction() throws -&gt; Int {
    // ...
}
let x = try? someThrowingFunction()
</code></pre>

<p>Here <code>x</code> can either have a value of <code>Int</code> or <code>nil</code>. The data flow is
often simplified by using <code>let</code> assignments in a conditional expression:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">func fetchEep() -&gt; Eep? {
    if let x = try? fetchEepFromDisk() { return x }
    if let x = try? fetchEepFromServer() { return x }
    return nil
}

          Go <a href="#go">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>Go has some fairly anemic error handling. It has panics, and error
values. Error values must be assigned (or explicitly ignored) but they
can be left unchecked and cause all kinds of issues.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Go exposed <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/go2draft-error-handling-overview.md">plans for new error
handling</a>
in future versions, which can be interesting.</p>

<p>Rather than changing semantics of their error handling, Go designers are
mostly considering syntactic changes to reduce the cumbersome nature of
their errors.</p>

<p>Go programs typically handled errors as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">func main() {
        hex, err := ioutil.ReadAll(os.Stdin)
        if err != nil {
                log.Fatal(err)
        }

        data, err := parseHexdump(string(hex))
        if err != nil {
                log.Fatal(err)
        }

        os.Stdout.Write(data)
}
</code></pre>

<p>The new proposed mechanism looks as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">func main() {
    handle err {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    hex := check ioutil.ReadAll(os.Stdin)
    data := check parseHexdump(string(hex))
    os.Stdout.Write(data)
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>check</code> keyword asks to implicitly check whether the second return
value <code>err</code> is equal to <code>nil</code> or not. If it is not equal to <code>nil</code>, the
latest defined <code>handle</code> block is called. It can return the result out to
exit the function, repair some values, or simply panic, to name a few
options.</p>
      <h3 id="elixir">
        
        
          Elixir <a href="#elixir">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>Elixir has a slightly different semantic approach to error handling compared
to Erlang. Exceptions are discouraged for control flow (while Erlang
specifically uses <code>throw</code> for it), and the <code>with</code> macro is introduced:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">with {:ok, var} &lt;- some_call(),
     {:error, _} &lt;- fail(),
     {:ok, x, y} &lt;- parse_name(var)
do
    success(x, y, var)
else
    {:error, err} -&gt; handle(err)
    nil -&gt; {:error, nil}
end
</code></pre>

<p>The macro allows a sequence of pattern matches, after which the ˋdo …ˋ
block is called. If any of the pattern matches fails, the failing value
gets re-matched in the optional ˋelse … end` section.</p>

<p>This is the most general control flow in this document, being fully
flexible with regards to which values it can handle. This was done in
part because there is not a strong norm regarding error or valid values
in either the Erlang nor Elixir APIs, at least compared to other
languages here.</p>

<p>This high level of flexibility has been criticized in some instances as
being a bit confusing: it is possible for users to make error-only
flows, success-only flows, mixed flows, and consequently the ˋelseˋ
clause can become convoluted.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/CrowdHailer/OK">OK library</a> was released to
explicitly narrow the workflow to well-defined errors. It supports three forms,
the first of which is the <code>for</code> block:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">OK.for do
  user &lt;- fetch_user(1)
  cart &lt;- fetch_cart(1)
  order = checkout(cart, user)
  saved_order &lt;- save_order(order)
after
  saved_order
end
</code></pre>

<p>It works by <em>only</em> matching on <code>{:ok, val}</code> to keep moving forwards when
using the <code>&lt;-</code> operator: the <code>fetch_user/1</code> function above must return
<code>{:ok, user}</code> in order for the code to proceed. The <code>=</code> operator is
allowed for pattern matches the same way it usually does within Elixir.</p>

<p>Any return value that matches <code>{:error, t}</code> ends up returning directly
out of the expression. The <code>after ... end</code> section takes the last value
returned, and if it isn’t already in a tuple of the form <code>{:ok val}</code>, it
wraps it as such.</p>

<p>The second variant is the <code>try</code> block:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">OK.try do
  user &lt;- fetch_user(1)
  cart &lt;- fetch_cart(1)
  order = checkout(cart, user)
  saved_order &lt;- save_order(order)
after
  saved_order
rescue
  :user_not_found -&gt; {:error, missing_user}
end
</code></pre>

<p>This variant will capture exceptions as well (in the <code>rescue</code> block),
and will not re-wrap the final return value in the <code>after</code> section.</p>

<p>The last variant for the library is the pipe:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">def get_employee_data(file, name) do
  {:ok, file}
  ~&gt;&gt; File.read
  ~&gt; String.upcase
end
</code></pre>

<p>The goal of this variant is to simply thread together operations that
could result in either a success or error. The <code>~&gt;&gt;</code> operator matches
and returns an <code>{:ok, term}</code> tuple, and the <code>~&gt;</code> operator wraps a value
into an <code>{:ok, term}</code> tuple.</p>
      <h2 id="whether-to-normalize-on-wrappers">
        
        
          Whether to Normalize on Wrappers <a href="#whether-to-normalize-on-wrappers">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>In Erlang, <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> are regular atoms that only gained special
status through usage in boolean expressions. It would be easy to think
that more functions would return <code>yes</code> and <code>no</code> were it not from control
flow constructs.</p>

<p>Similarly, <code>undefined</code> has over years of use become a kind of default
“not found” value. Values such as <code>nil</code>, <code>null</code>, <code>unknown</code>, <code>undef</code>,
<code>false</code> and so on have seen some use, but a strong consistency in format
has ended up aligning the community on one value.</p>

<p>When it comes to return values for various functions, <code>{ok, Term}</code> is
the most common one for positive results that need to communicate a
value, <code>ok</code> for positive results with no other value than their own
success, and <code>{error, Term}</code> is most often uses for errors. Pattern
matching and assertions have enforced that it is easy to know whether a
call worked or not by its own structure.</p>

<p>However, many success values are still larger tuples: <code>{ok, Val,
Warnings}</code>, <code>{ok, Code, Status, Headers, Body}</code>, and so on. Such
variations are not problematic on their own, but it would likely not
hurt too much either to use <code>{ok, {Val, Warnings}}</code> or <code>{ok, {Code,
Status, Headers, Body}}</code>.</p>

<p>While using more standard forms could lead to easier generalizations
and abstractions that can be applied to community-wide code. By choosing
specific formats for control flow on value-based error handling, we
would explicitly encourage this form of standardization.</p>

<p>That being said, the variety of formats existing and the low amount of strict
values being used would mean that forcing normalization calls for a potential
loss of flexibility in future language decisions. For example,
<a href="https://github.com/erlang/eep/blob/master/eeps/eep-0054.md">EEP-54</a>—completed
before final revisions of this RFC—tries to add new forms of context to error
reports, and various libraries already rely on these richer patterns.</p>

<p>It is therefore the opinion of the OTP technical board that we should <strong>not</strong>
normalize error-return values. As such, an approach closer to Elixir’s <code>with</code>
has been proposed, although this EEP’s approach is more general in terms of
sequences of acceptable expressions and their composition.</p>
      <h2 id="adding-the-else-block">
        
        
          Adding the else Block <a href="#adding-the-else-block">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>Avoiding normalization on error and good values introduces the need for the
<code>else ... end</code> sub-block to prevent edge cases.</p>

<p>Let’s look with the following type of expression as an explanation why:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">begin
    {ok, {X,Y}} &lt;- id({ok, {X,Y}})
    ...
end
</code></pre>

<p>While this mechanism is fine to handle skipping pattern, it has some
problematic weaknesses in the context of error handling.</p>

<p>One example of this could be taken from the OTP pull request that adds
new return value to packet reading based on inet options:
<a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/1950">#1950</a>.</p>

<p>This PR adds a possible value for packet reception to the prior form:</p>

<p>Based on socket options set earlier. So let’s put it in context for the
current proposal:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">begin
    {ok, {X,Y}} &lt;- id({ok, {X,Y}}),
    {ok, {PeerIP, PeerPort, Data}} &lt;- gen_udp:recv(...),
    ...
end
</code></pre>

<p>Since we force a return on any non-matching value, the whole expression, if
the socket is misconfigured to return <code>AncData</code>, would return <code>{ok, {PeerIP,
PeerPort, AncData, Data}}</code> on a failure to match.</p>

<p>Basically, an unexpected but good result could be returned from a
function using the <code>begin ... end</code> construct, which would look like a
success while it was actually a complete failure to match and handle the
information given. This is made even more ambiguous when data has the
right shape and type, but a set of bound variables ultimately define
whether the match succeeds or fails (in the case of a UDP socket,
returning values that comes from the wrong peer, for example).</p>

<p>In worst cases, It could let raw unformatted data exit a conditional
pipeline with no way to detect it after the fact, particularly if later
functions in <code>begin ... end</code> apply transformations to text, such as
anonymizing or sanitizing data. This could be pretty unsafe
and near impossible to debug well.</p>

<p>Think for example of:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">-spec fetch() -&gt; {ok, iodata()} | {error, _}.
fetch() -&gt;
    begin
        {ok, B = &lt;&lt;_/binary&gt;&gt;} &lt;- f(),
        true &lt;- validate(B),
        {ok, sanitize(B)}
    end.
</code></pre>

<p>If the value returned from <code>f()</code> turns out to be a list (say it’s a
misconfigured socket using <code>list</code> instead of <code>binary</code> as an option), the
expression will return early, the <code>fetch()</code> function will still return
<code>{ok, iodata()}</code> but you couldn’t know as a caller whether it is the
transformed data or non-matching content. It would not be obvious to
most developers either that this could represent a major security risk
by allowing unexpected data to be seen as clean data.</p>

<p>This specific type of error is in fact possible in Elixir, but no such
warning appears to have been circulating within its community so far.
The issue is to be handled with an <code>else</code> block which this proposal
reuses to clamp down on unexpected values:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">-spec fetch() -&gt; {ok, iodata()} | {error, _}.
fetch() -&gt;
    begin
        {ok, B = &lt;&lt;_/binary&gt;&gt;} &lt;- f(),
        true &lt;- validate(B),
        {ok, sanitize(B)}
    else
        false -&gt; {error, invalid_data};
        {error, R} -&gt; {error, R}
    end.
</code></pre>

<p>Here misconfigured sockets won’t result in unchecked data passing through
your app; any invalid use case is captured, and if the value for <code>B</code> turns
out to be a list, an <code>else_clause</code> error is raised with the bad value.</p>

<p>Unless the clause is mandatory (it is not in Elixir and we do not plan it here
either for compatibility reasons with existing <code>begin ... end</code> expressions),
this level of additional matching is purely optional; the developer has no
obvious incentive to go and handle these errors, and if they do, the exception
raised will be through a missing clause in the <code>else</code> section, which will
obscure its origin and line number.</p>

<p>We will therefore have to rely on education and documentation (along with
type analysis) to prevent such issues from arising in the future.</p>

<p>These problems would <em>not</em> exist with normalized error and return values as those used in statically-typed languages, but since we do not intend to normalize values, the <code>else</code> block is a necessary workaround.</p>

<p>Abstractions over error flow requires to define a scope limiting the
way flow is controlled. Before choosing the <code>begin ... end</code> expression,
the following items needed consideration:</p>

<ol>
  <li>what is the scope we need to cover</li>
  <li>what is the format of the structure to use</li>
  <li>why ending up with <code>begin ... end</code></li>
  <li>Why choose the <code>else</code> keyword</li>

          Scoping Limits <a href="#scoping-limits">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>In the languages mentioned earlier, two big error handling categories
seem to emerge.</p>

<p>The first group of language seems to track their error handling at the
function level. For example, Go uses <code>return</code> to return early from the
current function.  Swift and Rust also scope their error handling
abstractions to the current function, but they also make use of their
type signatures to keep information about the control flow
transformations taking place. Rust uses the <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> type
signature to define what operations are valid, and Swift asks of
developers that they either handle the error locally, or annotate the
function with <code>throws</code> to make things explicit.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Haskell’s do notation is restricted to specific
expressions, and so are all of Elixir’s mechanisms.</p>

<p>Erlang, Haskell, and Elixir all primarily use recursion as an iteration
mechanism, and (outside of Haskell’s monadic constructs) do not support
<code>return</code> control flow; it is conceptually more difficult for a <code>return</code>
(or <code>break</code>) to be useful when iteration requires recursion:
“returning” by exiting the current flow may not bail you out of what the
programmer might consider a loop, for example.</p>

<p>Instead, Erlang would use <code>throw()</code> exceptions as a control flow
mechanism for non-local return, along with a <code>catch</code> or a <code>try ...
catch</code>. Picking a value-based error handling construct that acts at the
function level would not necessarily be very interesting since almost
any recursive procedure would still require using exceptions.</p>

<p>As such, it feels simpler to use a self-contained construct built to
specifically focus on sequences of operations that contain value-based
errors.</p>
      <h3 id="format-of-structure">
        
        
          Format of Structure <a href="#format-of-structure">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>Prior attempts at abstracting value-based error handling in Erlang
overloaded special constructs with parse transforms in order to provide
specific workflows.</p>

<p>For example, the <a href="https://github.com/ferd/fancyflow"><code>fancyflow</code></a>
library tried to abstract the following code:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">sans_maybe() -&gt;
    case file:get_cwd() of
        {ok, Dir} -&gt;
            case
                file:read_file(
                  filename:join([Dir, "demo", "data.txt"]))
            of
                {ok, Bin} -&gt;
                    {ok, {byte_size(Bin), Bin}};
                {error, Reason} -&gt;
                    {error, Reason}
            end;
        {error, Reason} -&gt;
            {error, Reason}
    end.
</code></pre>

<p>as:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">-spec maybe() -&gt; {ok, non_neg_integer()} | {error, term()}.
maybe() -&gt;
    [maybe](undefined,
            file:get_cwd(),
            file:read_file(filename:join([_, "demo", "data.txt"])),
            {ok, {byte_size(_), _}}).
</code></pre>

<p>And Erlando would replace:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">write_file(Path, Data, Modes) -&gt;
    Modes1 = [binary, write | (Modes -- [binary, write])],
    case make_binary(Data) of
        Bin when is_binary(Bin) -&gt;
            case file:open(Path, Modes1) of
                {ok, Hdl} -&gt;
                    case file:write(Hdl, Bin) of
                        ok -&gt;
                            case file:sync(Hdl) of
                                ok -&gt;
                                    file:close(Hdl);
                                {error, _} = E -&gt;
                                    file:close(Hdl),
                                    E
                            end;
                        {error, _} = E -&gt;
                            file:close(Hdl),
                            E
                    end;
                {error, _} = E -&gt; E
            end;
        {error, _} = E -&gt; E
    end.
</code></pre>

<p>With monadic constructs in list comprehensions:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">write_file(Path, Data, Modes) -&gt;
    Modes1 = [binary, write | (Modes -- [binary, write])],
    do([error_m ||
        Bin &lt;- make_binary(Data),
        Hdl &lt;- file:open(Path, Modes1),
        Result &lt;- return(do([error_m ||
                             file:write(Hdl, Bin),
                             file:sync(Hdl)])),
        file:close(Hdl),
        Result]).
</code></pre>

<p>Those cases specifically aimed for a way to write sequences of
operations where pre-defined semantics are bound by a special context,
but are limited to overloading constructs rather than introducing new
ones.</p>

<p>By comparison, most of Erlang’s control flow expressions follow similar
structures. See the following most common ones:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">case ... of
    Pattern [when Guard] -&gt; Expressions
end

if
   Guard -&gt; Expressions
end

begin
    Expressions
end

receive
    Pattern [when Guard] -&gt; Expressions
after                                               % optional
    IntegerExp -&gt; Expressions
end

try
    Expressions
of                                                  % optional
    Pattern [when Guard] -&gt; Expressions
catch                                               % optional
    ExceptionPattern [when Guard] -&gt; Expressions
after                                               % optional
    Expressions
end
</code></pre>

<p>It therefore logically follows that if we were to add a new construct,
it should be of the form</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">&lt;keyword&gt;
    ...
end
</code></pre>

<p>The questions remaining are: which keyword to choose, and which clauses
to support.</p>
      <h3 id="choosing-begin--end">
        
        
          Choosing <code>begin ... end</code> <a href="#choosing-begin--end">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>Initially, a format similar to Elixir’s <code>with</code> expression was being
considered:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">&lt;keyword&gt;
    Expressions | UnwrapExpressions
of                                              % optional
    Pattern [when Guard] -&gt; Expressions
end
</code></pre>

<p>With this construct, the basic <code>&lt;keyword&gt; ... end</code> form would follow the
currently proposed semantics, but the <code>of ...</code> section would allow
pattern matching on any return value from the expression, whether
<code>{error, Reason}</code> or any non-exception value returned by the last
expression in the main section.</p>

<p>This form would be in line with what <code>try ... of ... catch ... end</code>
allows: once the main section is covered, more work can be done within
the same construct.</p>

<p>However, <code>try ... of ... catch ... end</code> has a specific reason for
introducing the patterns and guards: protected code impacting tail
recursion.</p>

<p>In a loop such as:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">map_nocrash(_, []) -&gt; [];
map_nocrash(F, [H|T]) -&gt;
    try
        F(H)
    of
        Val -&gt; [Val | map_nocrash(F, T)]
    catch
        _:_ -&gt; map_nocrash(F, T)
    end.
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>of</code> section allows to continue doing work in the case no exception
has happened, <em>without</em> having to protect more than the current scope of
the function, nor preventing tail-recursion by forcing a presence of
each iteration on the stack.</p>

<p>No such concerns exist for value-based error handling, and while the
 <code>of ... end</code> section might be convenient at times, it is strictly not
necessary for the construct to be useful.</p>

<p>What was left was to choose a name. Initially, the <code>&lt;keyword&gt;</code> value
chosen was <code>maybe</code>, based on the Maybe monad. The problem is that
introducing any new keyword carries severe risks to backwards
compatibility.</p>

<p>For example, all of the following words were considered:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">======= ================= =========================================
Keyword Times used in OTP Rationale
         as a function
======= ================= =========================================
maybe   0                 can clash with existing used words,
                           otherwise respects the spirit
option  88                definitely clashes with existing code
opt     68                definitely clashes with existing code
check   49                definitely clashes with existing code
let     0                 word is already reserved and free, but
                           makes no sense in context
cond    0                 word is already reserved and free, may
                           make sense, but would prevent the
                           addition of a conditional expression
given   0                 could work, kind of respects the context
when    0                 reserved for guards, could hijack in new
                          context but may be confusing
begin   0                 carries no conditional meaning, mostly
                          free for overrides
</code></pre>

<p>Initially, this proposal expected to use the <code>maybe</code> keyword:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">maybe
    Pattern &lt;op&gt; Exp,
    ...
of
    Pattern -&gt; Exp  % optional
end
</code></pre>

<p>but for the reasons mentioned in the previous section, the <code>of ...</code>
section became non-essential.</p>

<p>Then, with the strong requirements for backwards compatibility making it
difficult to introduce new keywords, along with the possibility to reuse
<code>begin</code> without changing any of its current behavior, this form became the
most interesting one.</p>

<p>The term <code>begin</code> is also reminiscent of transactions and abortive
contexts, which means that although not an ideal fit for value-based
error flow, it is also not entirely outlandish and could accept the new
added optional semantics without being too out of place.</p>
      <h3 id="why-choose-the-else-keyword">
        
        
          Why Choose the <code>else</code> keyword <a href="#why-choose-the-else-keyword">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>The first step here was looking at all the existing alternative reserved
keywords: <code>of</code>, <code>when</code>, <code>cond</code>, <code>catch</code>, <code>after</code>.</p>

<p>None of these actually conveys the sense of requiring an alternative clause to
the construct, and so we require adding a new one. The <code>else</code> keyword is
tempting if only because it opens the door to introducing it as a reserved word
in <code>if</code> expressions at a later date.</p>

<p>A quick look at the OTP code base to be sure seems to return no <code>else()</code>
function and should therefore be relatively safe to use in general.</p>

      </h2>
    

<p>In order to form <code>MatchOrReturnExprs</code>, there is a need for a mechanism to
introduce pattern matching with distinct semantics from regular pattern
matching.</p>

<p>A naive parse transform approach with fake function calls would be the
most basic way to go:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">begin
    match_or_return(Pattern, Exp),
    % variables bound in Pattern are available in scope
    ...
end
</code></pre>

<p>However, this would introduce pattern matches in non-left-hand-side
positions and make nesting really weird to deal with without exposing
parse transform details and knowing how the code is translated.</p>

<p>A prefix keyword such <code>let &lt;Pattern&gt; = &lt;Exp&gt;</code> could also be used.
Such keywords unfortunately suffer the same issues as <code>maybe</code> would
have, and <code>let</code> typically has different implications.</p>

<p>An infix operator seems like a good fit since pattern matching already
uses them in multiple forms:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>=</code> is used for pattern matches. Overloading it in error flow would
prevent regular matching from being used</li>
  <li><code>:=</code> is used for maps; using it could work, but would certainly be
confusing when handling nested maps in a pattern</li>
  <li><code>&lt;-</code> could make sense. It is already restricted in scope to list and
binary comprehensions and would therefore not clash nor be confused.
The existing semantics of the operator imply a literal
pattern match working like a filter, which is what we are looking for.</li>
  <li><code>&lt;=</code> same as <code>&lt;-</code> but for binary generators</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>&lt;-</code> operator makes the most sense and shouldn’t be confusing for
anyone.</p>

<p>For completeness’s sake, I also checked for alternative operators
in a prior version of this EEP that introduced prescriptive values
for <code>{ok, T} | {error, R}</code>, which had distinct semantics:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">=======  ===========================================================

#=       no clash with other syntax (maps, records, integers), no
         clash with abstract patterns EEP either.

         to C-style inequality checks
&lt;~       Works with no known conflict; shouldn't clash with ROK's
         frame proposals (uses infix ~ and &lt; &gt; as delimiters).
&lt;|       reverse pipe operator. No obvious clash either
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>&lt;-</code> operator from list comprehensions is the most adequate
option, both in terms of simplicity and cognitive costs.</p>

<p>Within the expected usage of the unwrap expressions, the <code>&lt;~</code> operator
needs to have a precedence rule such that:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">X = {Y,X} &lt;- &lt;Exp&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Is considered a valid pattern match operation with <code>X = {Y,X}</code> being the

    [H|T] &lt;~ id({ok, [1,2,3]}),
    ...
end
</code></pre>

<p>Which implicitly unpacked <code>{ok, T} = f()</code> by calling <code>T &lt;~ f()</code>, and forced
all acceptable non-matching values to be of the form <code>{error, T}.</code></p>

<p>To make the form useful to most existing code, it also required some magic
everyone (myself included) didn’t very much like, for which <code>_ &lt;~ f()</code> would
implicitly succeed if the return value for <code>f()</code> was <code>ok</code>.</p>

<p>This was judged to be too magical, and not necessarily a ton of existing
Erlang code would have benefited from the form since <code>ok</code> is often returned
for successful functions without an extra value. A stronger prescriptiveness
of the form <code>{ok, undefined}</code> (to replicate Rust’s <code>Ok(())</code>) would have
been required to avoid the magic, and would have felt very unidiomatic.</p>

      </h3>
    

<p>The Elixir approach is fairly comprehensive, and rather powerful. Rather
than handling success or errors, it generalizes over pattern matching as
a whole, as we do here.</p>

<p>The one difference is that Elixir’s <code>with</code> expression forces all
conditionals to happen first, with a <code>do</code> block for the free-form
expressions that follow:</p>

<p>with dob &lt;- parse_dob(params[“dob”]),</p>
<pre><code class="language-erlang">    name &lt;- parse_name(params["name"])
do
  %User{dob: dob, name: name}
else
  err -&gt; err
end
</code></pre>

<p>The Erlang form introduced in this document is more general since it
allows mixing <code>MatchOrReturnExprs</code> and regular expressions throughout,
without the need for a general <code>do</code> block.</p>

<p>The Erlang form does imply a likely more complex set of rewriting rules when
translating from the AST form to Core Erlang. <a href="https://gist.github.com/ferd/2f1134fd88615354fbf89c068216b259">It should be possible to purely
rewrite in existing Core Erlang terms although the end result may not look like
the original code at

      </h3>
    

<p>Anthony Ramine recommended looking into reusing the already reserved
<code>cond</code> and <code>let</code> keywords. He mentioned Rust planning something based on
these and how it could be ported to Erlang based on his prior work on
supporting the <code>cond</code> construct within the language.</p>

<p>The proposed mechanism would look like:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">cond
    X &gt; 5 -&gt; % regular guard
        Exp;
    f() &lt; 18 -&gt; % function used in guard, as originally planned
        Exp;
    let {ok, Y} = exp(), Y &lt; 5 -&gt;
        Exp
end
</code></pre>

<p>The last clause would allow <code>Y</code> to be used in its own branch only if it
matches and all guards succeed; if the binding fails, a switch is
automatically made to the next branch.</p>

<p>As such, more complex sequences of operations could be covered as:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erlang">cond
    let {ok, _} = call1(),
    let {ok, _} = call2(),
    let Res = call3() -&gt;
        Res;
    true -&gt;
        AlternativeBranch
end
</code></pre>

<p>This mechanism is, in my opinion, worth exploring and maybe adding to
the language, but on its own does not adequately solve error handling
flow issues since errors cannot be extracted easily from failing
operations.</p>

          Auto-Wrapping Return Values <a href="#auto-wrapping-return-values">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>Auto-wrapping return values is something the Elixir’s <code>OK</code> library does,
as well as Haskell’s do notation, but that neither Rust nor Swift does.</p>

<p>It seems that there is no very clear consensus on what could be done.
Thus, for the simplicity of the implementation and backwards
compatibility of the <code>begin ... end</code> expression, just returning the
value as-is without auto-wrapping seems sensible, particularly
since we do not prescribe tuple formats for handled values.</p>

<p>It would therefore be up to the developer to just return whatever value
best matches their function’s type signature, making easier to still
integrate return values with the system they have.</p>

<p>It also lets sequences of operations potentially return <code>ok</code> on success,
even if their individual functions returned values such as <code>true</code>, for
example, rather than <code>{ok, true}</code>.</p>

          Choosing Exceptions Raised <a href="#choosing-exceptions-raised">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>The exception format proposed here is <code>{else_clause, Value}</code>. This format
is chosen following Erlang/OTP standards:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>if_clause</code></li>
  <li><code>{case_clause, Val}</code></li>
  <li><code>function_clause</code> (the value is provided in the stacktrace)</li>
  <li><code>{badmatch, Val}</code></li>
  <li>Unmatching values in a <code>catch</code> block and <code>receive</code> expressions do not raise
anything explicitly</li>
</ul>

<p>Since <code>case_clause</code> is functionally the closest exceptions and that it carries
a value, we choose to replicate the same form here.</p>

<p>The reason <code>else_clause</code> is chosen over <code>begin_clause</code> because the <code>else</code> block
could arguably be used in other constructs in the future, and constraining the
exception to the block’s name itself is likely more future-proof.</p>

          Backwards Compatibility <a href="#backwards-compatibility">#</a>
        
        
      </h1>
    

<p>The possibility of an early exit from a <code>begin ... end</code> expression
means that variables declared within its scope are now potentially
unsafe to use outside of it.</p>

<p>This is a change of behaviour that brings <code>begin</code> in line with the
variables bound within a <code>case ... end</code> branch, a <code>try/catch</code> clause, or
a <code>receive ... end</code> branch. The same is true of the <code>else</code> block.</p>

<p>This lack of safety only needs to be started at the first <code>MatchOrReturnExpr</code>
encountered, since all variables bound before respect the same semantics as the
existing <code>begin ... end</code> expression. If this analysis is done rather than just
declaring all variables as unsafe wholesale, then there is no backwards
compatibility concern to be had.</p>

<p>The need for the <code>&lt;-</code> operator to be used in a new context means code built
with support for the new expressions won’t be portable to older Erlang
releases. However, if all the code is rewritten <em>after</em> the AST and reuses
existing core Erlang components, built BEAM artifacts should work on older
versions fine. This is, however, not a supported use case by the OTP team.</p>

<p>No reference implementation is usually required at this step.
One is to be developed at a later point in time.</p>
