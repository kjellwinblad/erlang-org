        release_note: "The by autoconf generated configure scripts are now commited into the git repository and will thus always be available. This ensures that the scripts have been generated by an autoconf version that has been tested and by this preventing misconfiguration of OTP. The ./otp_build autoconf build step is therefore no longer necessary and will if executed only print a message and then exit successfully. Currently the configure scripts will be generated using the by Debian patched autoconf version 2.69-11.\n\n"
