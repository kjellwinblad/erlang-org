Beside delaying various cleanup of internal data structures also the following could be delayed:\n\n-- Termination of a distribution controller process\n\n-- Disabling of the distribution on a node\n\n-- Gathering of memory allocator information using the instrument module\n\n-- Enabling, disabling, and gathering of msacc information\n\n-- Delivery of 'CHANGE' messages when time offset is monitored\n\n-- A call to erlang:cancel_timer()\n\n-- A call to erlang:read_timer()\n\n-- A call to erlang:statistics(io | garbage_collection | scheduler_wall_time)\n\n-- A call to ets:all()\n\n-- A call to erlang:memory()\n\n-- A call to erlang:system_info({allocator | allocator_sizes, _})\n\n-- A call to erlang:trace_delivered()\n\nThe bug existed on runtime systems running on all types of hardware except for x86/x86_64.\n\n"
