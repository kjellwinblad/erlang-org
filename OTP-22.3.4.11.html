When the bugs were triggered, certain operations were delayed until a thread woke up due to some other reason.

      OTP-16856:
        release_note: "As of OTP 22, the allocator specific memory carrier pools were replaced by a node global carrier pool. This unfortunately caused substantial memory fragmentation in some cases due to long lived data being spread into carriers used by allocators mainly handling short lived data.\n\nA new command line argument +M<S>cp has been introduced with which one can enable the old behavior as well as configuring other behaviors for the carrier pools. In order to configure the old behavior, with allocator specific carrier pools for all allocators, pass +Mucp : (including the colon character) as a command line argument to erl when starting the Erlang system.\n\nThe default configuration for carrier pools will be changed to +Mucp : some time in the future, but not in this patch.\n\n"
