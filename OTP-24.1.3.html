      OTP-17677:
        release_note: "This fixes a bug in erts_factory_undo that caused the heap to not be reset correctly. The erts_factory_undo function is, for example, called when a binary_to_term/1 call fails to reset the heap to its state before the binary_to_term/1 call. This can cause the heap to contain invalid terms which potentially can cause issues (e.g., crashes) when the whole heap is scanned.\n\n"

Magic references are NIF resources or returned from BIFs like ets:new, atomics:new. The bug could cause the memory of the referred resource to be prematurely deallocated.\n\nThe bug also apply to magic references in message passing on a runtime built with configure option --enable-sharing-preserving.\n\nBug exist for 64-bit since OTP-24.0 and for 32-bit since OTP-20.0.\n\n"

      OTP-17722:
        release_note: "The following two bugs that caused erlang:demonitor() to behave erroneously have been fixed. The bugs were only triggered if the monitor that was removed by demonitor() had previously been created simultaneously as a monitor and as an alias.\n\n-- A demonitor operation on a monitor created using the {alias, reply_demonitor} option erroneously behaved as if the {alias, explicit_unalias} option had been used.\n\n-- A demonitor operation did not prevent a corresponding 'DOWN' message from being delivered if the monitor reference was kept as an active alias after the operation. This could only occur if the monitored process simultaneously terminated before the demonitor signal reached it, and the exit reason was not an immediate term. That is, a term larger than one machine word.\n\n"
